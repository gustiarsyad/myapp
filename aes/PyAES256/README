AES-256 cryptographic library for Python.
=========================================

This is a basic encryption AES-256 library for Python. Currently, only the
ANSI X.923 byte padding is supported.
  
An example usage of the module is:
>>> import aes256
>>> key = "aserghjerg4w5ygb8JHBr8ySuhrergiE"
>>> encrypted = aes256.encrypt("My testing clear text", key)
>>> decrypted = aes256.decrypt(encrypted, key)
>>>> print "decrypted: %s" % decrypted
My testing clear text


Installation
============

The toolkit is written and tested using Python 2.6, though it should
also work with previous versions of Python 2.x.

The modules are packaged using the Distutils, so you can simply run
"python setup.py build" to build the package, and "python setup.py
install" to install it.
